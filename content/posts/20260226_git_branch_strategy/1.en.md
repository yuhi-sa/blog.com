## Introduction

In team development, Git branching strategy is a critical factor affecting code quality and development velocity. This article compares major branching strategies and explains when to use `rebase` vs `merge`.

## Branching Strategies

### Git Flow

Proposed by Vincent Driessen, using multiple branch types:

| Branch      | Purpose             | Lifecycle |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| `main`      | Released code       | Permanent |
| `develop`   | Integration branch  | Permanent |
| `feature/*` | New features        | Temporary |
| `release/*` | Release preparation | Temporary |
| `hotfix/*`  | Emergency fixes     | Temporary |

```bash
# Create and complete a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-auth develop
# ... develop ...
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/user-auth
git branch -d feature/user-auth
```

**Best for**: Products with clear release cycles, parallel version maintenance.

### GitHub Flow

Simple strategy with only `main` and feature branches:

```bash
# 1. Branch from main
git checkout -b feature/add-search main

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add search functionality"
git push -u origin feature/add-search

# 3. Create Pull Request for review

# 4. Merge to main (via PR)

# 5. Deploy
```

**Best for**: Continuous deployment, web applications, small-to-medium teams.

### Trunk-Based Development

All developers commit directly to `main` (trunk) or use short-lived branches:

```bash
# Short-lived branch (merge within 1-2 days)
git checkout -b fix/typo main
# ... fix ...
git checkout main
git merge fix/typo
git branch -d fix/typo
```

**Best for**: Teams with mature CI/CD, organizations using feature flags.

### Comparison

| Strategy    | Complexity | Release Management | CI/CD Required | Team Size    |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| Git Flow    | High       | Explicit           | No             | Large        |
| GitHub Flow | Low        | Simple             | Recommended    | Small-Medium |
| Trunk-Based | Medium     | Continuous         | Yes            | Any          |

## rebase vs merge

### merge (merge commit)

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/add-search
```

- Creates a merge commit
- **Preserves** branch and merge history
- Single conflict resolution point

### rebase

```bash
git checkout feature/add-search
git rebase main
```

- **Replays** commits on top of `main`
- Creates linear history
- May need conflict resolution per commit

### Guidelines

| Situation                    | Recommended       | Reason                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Updating feature branch      | `rebase`          | Linear history, cleaner diffs |
| Integrating to shared branch | `merge --no-ff`   | Clear merge points            |
| Already pushed branch        | `merge`           | rebase rewrites history       |
| Solo development             | `rebase`          | Cleaner history               |
| Team development             | `merge` or squash | Safer, easier to understand   |

### squash merge

Combines all feature branch commits into one:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature/add-search
git commit -m "feat: add search functionality"
```

GitHub PRs support this via the "Squash and merge" button.

## Commit Message Convention

### Conventional Commits

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

| type       | Usage            |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature      |
| `fix`      | Bug fix          |
| `docs`     | Documentation    |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring |
| `test`     | Adding tests     |
| `chore`    | Build/tooling    |

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth 2.0 login support"
git commit -m "fix(api): handle null response from payment service"
```

## Practical Workflow

### Feature Branch Workflow

```bash
# 1. Get latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-api

# 3. Periodically sync with main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# 4. Push (force-push needed after rebase)
git push -f origin feature/new-api

# 5. Create PR → Review → Merge
```

### Conflict Resolution

```bash
# When conflicts occur during rebase
git rebase main
# ... resolve conflicts manually ...
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue

# To abort the rebase
git rebase --abort
```
