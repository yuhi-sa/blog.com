## TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP is a collective term for communication protocol suites used in many networks including the Internet. It is organized as a **protocol stack** that hierarchically divides communication functions, and is generally divided into the following four layers.

-   **Application Layer**:
    -   Defines the rules for sending and receiving data by applications used by users (web browsers, email clients, etc.). It also handles data representation formats (character encoding, image formats, etc.).
    -   Protocol examples: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, DNS
-   **Transport Layer**:
    -   Defines the rules for reliably or rapidly transferring data between applications. It handles establishing data transmission between communicating programs, error control, flow control, etc.
    -   Protocol examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
-   **Internet Layer**:
    -   Identifies the destination of data on the network and determines the optimal path (routing) from source to destination.
    -   Protocol examples: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
-   **Network Interface Layer**:
    -   Handles the process of sending data received from the Internet layer onto the physical network medium (Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, etc.). It handles conversion to electrical signals, communication using MAC addresses, etc.

## Connection-Oriented and Connectionless Communication

-   **Connection-Oriented Communication**:
    -   Before communication begins, the sender and receiver **establish a connection**, and maintain that connection during data transmission.
    -   **Acknowledgments** to confirm data delivery, sequence guarantees, and retransmission control provide high reliability.
    -   Example: TCP (web communication, email sending, etc.)
-   **Connectionless Communication**:
    -   Communication begins without establishing a connection, and data is sent unilaterally.
    -   Since there are no acknowledgments or sequence guarantees, reliability is lower, but overhead is minimal and speed is high.
    -   Example: UDP (video streaming, voice calls, etc.)

## Communication Methods

-   **Unicast**:
    -   One-to-one communication. Data is sent from a specific source to a specific single destination.
-   **Broadcast**:
    -   Data is sent to **all hosts** within the same network.
-   **Multicast**:
    -   Data is sent to **multiple hosts** belonging to a specific group. Used when sending data to multiple hosts registered with the same IP address.
-   **Anycast**:
    -   Data is sent to the **nearest host** (in terms of routing) among multiple hosts with a specific IP address. Primarily used for DNS servers, contributing to load balancing and redundancy.

## Types of IP Addresses

-   **Global IP Address**:
    -   An IP address **uniquely** assigned on the Internet. Used by devices directly connected to the Internet.
    -   Managed by the international organization IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), allocated to ISPs (Internet Service Providers) through regional registries (JPNIC in Japan), and provided to users by ISPs.
-   **Private IP Address**:
    -   An IP address usable only within an organization's local network (LAN). Not directly accessible from the Internet.
    -   Specific IP address ranges are reserved as private IP addresses, and each organization can freely assign and use them.

## Port Numbers

Port numbers are numbers used in TCP/IP communication to **identify the application or service** sending and receiving data. While an IP address identifies the destination computer, a port number specifies which application on that computer to communicate with.

-   **Well-Known Ports**: Port numbers from 0 to 1023, assigned to specific standard services.
    -   20: FTP (data transfer)
    -   21: FTP (control)
    -   22: SSH (Secure Shell)
    -   23: Telnet
    -   25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
    -   53: DNS (Domain Name System)
    -   80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
    -   110: POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)
    -   143: IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
    -   443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
