K-means is a type of **non-hierarchical clustering**. Non-hierarchical clustering partitions given data into a predetermined number of clusters $K$, seeking a grouping where each cluster contains elements with similar properties. Unlike hierarchical clustering, it does not produce a hierarchical structure, making it well suited for analyzing large-scale (big data) datasets.

K-means measures the distance between data points and cluster centers (centroids), and partitions the data into $K$ clusters so that these distances are minimized. The centroid $c_j$ of each cluster $C_j$ is computed as the mean of the data points belonging to that cluster.

$$ c_j = \frac{1}{|C_j|} \sum_{x \in C_j} x $$

K-means performs clustering by minimizing the following **objective function**. This function represents the sum of squared distances from each data point to the centroid of the cluster it belongs to, and takes smaller values when within-cluster cohesion is high.

$$ J = \sum_{j=1}^K \sum_{x \in C_j} ||x - c_j||^2 $$

### The K-Means Algorithm

1.  **Initialization**: Randomly select $K$ points from the data as **initial cluster centroids**.
2.  **Assignment step (E-step)**: For each data point, find the nearest cluster centroid and assign the data point to that cluster.
3.  **Update step (M-step)**: Compute the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster and set it as the new cluster centroid.
4.  **Convergence check**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer move or a predetermined maximum number of iterations is reached.

K-means is simple and fast, which makes it widely used. However, it has several known limitations: results depend on the choice of initial centroids, it assumes spherical cluster shapes, and the number of clusters $K$ must be specified in advance.
