## Overview

I attended "AWS Summit Tokyo 2023" held at Makuhari Messe on April 20th and 21st, 2023.

-   **Event**: [AWS Summit Tokyo](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/summits/tokyo/)
-   **Date**: April 20 (Thu) - 21 (Fri), 2023
-   **Venue**: Makuhari Messe

I arrived at the venue around 10:30 AM and was able to enter relatively smoothly. According to Twitter, it was quite crowded before 10:00 AM. During pre-registration, there was an instruction to "print and bring your admission ticket," and I wondered why printing was necessary. It turned out that the printout was to be placed inside a name badge distributed at the venue (you could also get one printed on-site if you forgot). The QR code on this badge was used for seminar entry/exit management.

## Exhibition Booths

Many companies had booths, and I was able to have one-on-one conversations with representatives, which was very informative.

## Seminars

It was my first experience attending a seminar using a transceiver to listen to the presentation. Even seminars that were fully booked during pre-registration could be entered through same-day admission slots.
