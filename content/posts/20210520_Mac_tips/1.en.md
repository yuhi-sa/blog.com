Mac's Launchpad provides a convenient way to view and launch installed applications. However, after repeatedly installing and uninstalling apps, the icon layout can become cluttered or contain leftover icons, making it difficult to use.

If you want to reset the Launchpad layout to its initial state, run the following command in Terminal:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock
```

### Command Explanation

-   `defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true`:
    -   `defaults`: A command-line utility for interacting with the macOS user defaults system.
    -   `write`: Instructs `defaults` to write a value.
    -   `com.apple.dock`: Specifies the domain for the Dock application's settings (Launchpad is managed as part of the Dock).
    -   `ResetLaunchPad`: The key used to trigger the Launchpad layout reset.
    -   `-bool true`: Sets the `ResetLaunchPad` key to `true`.

-   `;`: A command separator, allowing multiple commands to be executed sequentially.
-   `killall Dock`:
    -   `killall`: A command that terminates all processes with a specified name.
    -   `Dock`: The process name for the Dock application.

Executing this command restarts the Dock process, which then rebuilds the Launchpad layout in its initial state. Applications will be organized alphabetically, and Apple's native apps will be placed on the first page, similar to a fresh installation.

**Note**:
-   This operation is irreversible. Any custom grouping or folder organization of icons will be lost.
-   After execution, the screen may flicker or the Dock may temporarily disappear, but it will restart shortly.
