In Python development, managing different Python versions and libraries for each project is very important. This article explains how to build a flexible and efficient Python development environment by combining `pyenv` and `Anaconda`.

## 1. Installing Homebrew

### What is Homebrew?

Homebrew is a **package manager** for macOS (and Linux). It allows you to easily install, update, and uninstall software from the command line.

### Installation Method

1.  Open Terminal.
2.  Run the following script:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
3.  Installation is complete when `Installation Successful` is displayed.

### Basic Usage

- `brew update`: Update Homebrew's package list.
- `brew upgrade`: Upgrade installed packages to the latest version.
- `brew list`: Display a list of installed packages.
- `brew install [package name]`: Install the specified package.
- `brew uninstall [package name]`: Uninstall the specified package.
- `brew info [package name]`: Display detailed information about the specified package.

## 2. Installing pyenv

### What is pyenv?

`pyenv` is a **Python version management tool** that allows you to install multiple Python versions on your system and easily switch between them on a per-project or per-directory basis. This avoids version conflicts between different projects.

### Installation Method

1.  Install `pyenv` using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install pyenv
    ```
2.  Set environment variables and load the `pyenv` initialization script into your shell:

    ```bash
    echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.bash_profile # Adds pyenv's executable path to environment variables.
    echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile # Runs the initialization script to enable pyenv commands.
    ```

    - `~/.bash_profile`: A configuration file automatically loaded when the Bash shell starts.
    - `export PATH="..."`: Adds pyenv's binary directory to the executable search path.
    - `eval "$(pyenv init -)"`: Runs the initialization script to enable pyenv commands.

    **Note**: If you are using Zsh, add these to `~/.zshrc`; for Fish, add them to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`. To apply the changes, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bash_profile` (or the applicable configuration file).

## 3. Installing Anaconda

### What is Anaconda?

Anaconda is a Python **distribution** specialized for data science and machine learning. In addition to Python itself, many scientific computing libraries and tools such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook are pre-packaged, significantly reducing the effort needed for environment setup.

### Installation Method

1.  Search for Anaconda versions available for installation through `pyenv`:

    ```bash
    pyenv install -l | grep anaconda
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
    anaconda-1.4.0
    ...
    anaconda3-5.3.1
    ...
    ```

    The `grep` command filters lines containing "anaconda" from the output of `pyenv install -l` piped through `|`.

2.  Install the Anaconda version corresponding to the latest Python 3 (e.g., `anaconda3-5.3.1`):

    ```bash
    pyenv install anaconda3-5.3.1
    ```

    Installation may take some time.

3.  Set the installed Anaconda environment to be used globally (system-wide):
    ```bash
    pyenv global anaconda3-5.3.1
    ```
    This makes the Anaconda environment the default when opening a terminal. If you want to use it only in a specific project, run `pyenv local anaconda3-5.3.1` in that directory.

With these steps, you have a development environment that integrates Python version management through `pyenv` with `Anaconda`'s rich library collection.
