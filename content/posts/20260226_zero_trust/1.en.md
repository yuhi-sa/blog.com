## Introduction

Traditional network security was based on the **perimeter defense model**, protecting the enterprise network "boundary" with firewalls and VPNs. However, cloud adoption, remote work expansion, and BYOD have blurred the line between the trusted "inside" and untrusted "outside."

**Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** is a security model based on the principle "Never trust, always verify."

## History of Zero Trust

| Year | Event                                                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2010 | John Kindervag at Forrester Research coined "Zero Trust"                 |
| 2014 | Google published BeyondCorp papers (eliminating VPN for internal access) |
| 2020 | NIST published SP 800-207 "Zero Trust Architecture"                      |
| 2021 | US Executive Order 14028 mandated Zero Trust for federal agencies        |

## Core Principles (NIST SP 800-207)

NIST SP 800-207 defines seven core principles:

1. **All data sources and computing services are considered resources**
   - Personal devices accessing enterprise resources are managed as resources

2. **All communication is secured regardless of network location**
   - Internal LAN traffic is encrypted and authenticated

3. **Access to individual resources is granted on a per-session basis**
   - No persistent access from a single authentication

4. **Access is determined by dynamic policy**
   - User ID, device state, location, time, behavioral patterns are holistically evaluated

5. **Integrity and security posture of all assets are monitored and measured**
   - Unpatched or misconfigured devices receive lower trust scores

6. **Authentication and authorization are strictly enforced before access**
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and least privilege principle

7. **Collected data is continuously used to improve security posture**
   - Log analysis, anomaly detection, and policy optimization cycles

## Key Components

### Logical Architecture

```

[Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)]  ← Access control point
    ↓
[Policy Administrator (PA)]       ← Establishes/terminates connections
    ↓
[Policy Engine (PE)]              ← Access decision brain
    ↑
  ┌─────────────────┐
  │ Data Sources      │
  │ · Identity Provider (IdP) │
  │ · SIEM / Log Analysis     │

| Component                          | Role                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Policy Engine (PE)**             | Makes access decisions based on context            |
| **Policy Administrator (PA)**      | Establishes/terminates sessions per PE decisions   |
| **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)** | Gateway that enforces actual access control        |
| **Identity Provider (IdP)**        | User authentication and attribute provision        |
| **SIEM**                           | Security event collection and correlation analysis |
| **MDM/EDR**                        | Device health and security posture assessment      |

## Comparison with Perimeter Defense

| Aspect                     | Perimeter Defense     | Zero Trust                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Trust basis                | Network location      | Verified identity + context          |
| Internal network treatment | Implicitly trusted    | Never trusted, always verified       |
| Access control             | Network-level         | Resource-level                       |
| VPN requirement            | Essential             | Unnecessary (per-application access) |
| Lateral movement defense   | Limited               | Suppressed via micro-segmentation    |
| Visibility                 | Boundary traffic only | All communications visible           |
| Remote work support        | VPN-dependent         | Same policy regardless of location   |

## Implementation Approaches

### Identity-Centric

Strengthen identity management and MFA for trust-based access control.

- Universal SSO + MFA deployment
- Contextual authentication (device, location, time, risk score)
- Just-in-Time (JIT) access

### Network-Centric

Use micro-segmentation to divide networks finely and prevent lateral movement.

- VLAN / firewall rule granularization
- Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
- East-west traffic inspection

### Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP)

Control access at the application level, hiding the network itself. Resources are invisible until authentication succeeds.

## Phased Implementation Plan

| Phase       | Measures                   | Goal                                                             |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Identity foundation        | Deploy MFA for all users, SSO integration, identity governance   |
| **Phase 2** | Device trust establishment | Deploy MDM/EDR, device health checks, compliance verification    |
| **Phase 3** | Micro-segmentation         | Network segmentation, per-application access control             |
| **Phase 4** | Continuous monitoring      | SIEM integration, anomaly detection, automated policy adjustment |

## Implementation Challenges

### Legacy System Integration

Older systems may not support modern authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, SAML). Proxy or adapter layers may be needed.

### User Experience Impact

Increased authentication frequency may reduce convenience. Balance with risk-based authentication and passkeys.

### Cost and Complexity

Phased deployment is recommended, starting with high-ROI areas (privileged access management, critical data protection).
