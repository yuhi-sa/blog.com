Apache Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL database with high availability and scalability. This guide explains how to install and start Cassandra on macOS using Homebrew.

## 1. Installing Cassandra

This assumes that Homebrew is already installed. If not, please refer to the [official Homebrew website](https://brew.sh) to install it.

Open a terminal and run the following command to install Cassandra:

```bash
brew install cassandra
```
This command installs Cassandra itself along with command-line tools for interacting with Cassandra (such as `cqlsh`).

## 2. Starting the Cassandra Server

Once the installation is complete, start the Cassandra server with the following command. Using Homebrew's `services` command allows you to start and manage Cassandra as a background service.

```bash
brew services start cassandra
```
To verify that Cassandra has started successfully, use the following command:
```bash
brew services list
```
If the status of `cassandra` shows `started`, it was successful.

## 3. Starting CQLSH (Cassandra Query Language Shell)

Once Cassandra is running, you can use `cqlsh` to connect to the Cassandra cluster and execute CQL (Cassandra Query Language) commands.

```bash
cqlsh
```
If the connection is successful, a `cqlsh>` prompt will appear.

```
Connected to Test Cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042.
[cqlsh 6.0.0 | Cassandra 4.0.6 | CQL spec 3.4.5 | Native protocol v12]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh>
```

With this, the basic Cassandra development environment is set up on macOS.

## Appendix: Stopping and Restarting Cassandra

-   **Stop**:
    ```bash
    brew services stop cassandra
    ```
-   **Restart**:
    ```bash
    brew services restart cassandra
    ```
