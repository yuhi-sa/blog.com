As the demand for cybersecurity professionals continues to grow, certifications remain one of the most effective ways to validate expertise. This article compares two prominent security certifications: **CISSP**, the global gold standard, and **Japan's Registered Information Security Specialist (RISS / 情報処理安全確保支援士)**, a national qualification with legal standing in Japan.

## CISSP Overview

### Certifying Body

CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) is issued by **(ISC)²** (International Information System Security Certification Consortium), a global nonprofit organization dedicated to information security education and certification.

### Exam Domains

CISSP covers eight domains of knowledge:

## Difficulty and Study Period

### What Makes CISSP Challenging

- **Broad management perspective**: The exam tests not just technical knowledge but risk management, governance, and business alignment
- **English proficiency**: While available in Japanese, most study materials and community resources are in English
- **Experience-based questions**: With 5 years of experience as a prerequisite, questions often require practical judgment rather than rote knowledge
- **Adaptive testing**: The CAT format adjusts difficulty based on performance, which can be mentally taxing

### What Makes RISS Challenging

- **Technical depth**: Questions require implementation-level knowledge of networks, applications, and systems
- **Written response format**: The afternoon section demands reading comprehension and structured written answers under time pressure
- **Japan-specific regulations**: Candidates must understand domestic laws like the Unauthorized Computer Access Law and Personal Information Protection Act
- **Morning I breadth**: The general IT fundamentals section can be an unexpected hurdle for specialists

### Estimated Study Time by Background

| Background           | CISSP                    | RISS        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 3+ years in security | 3–6 months               | 2–4 months  |
| IT experience only   | 6–12 months              | 4–8 months  |
| IT beginner          | Cannot meet requirements | 6–12 months |

## Career Impact

### Domestic (Japan)

- **RISS**:
  - Specified in government and municipal procurement requirements
  - Highly trusted as a national qualification; often qualifies for promotion or certification allowances
  - Approximately 24,000 registered holders (as of 2025), making it relatively rare
- **CISSP**:
  - Highly valued at foreign-affiliated and global companies operating in Japan
  - Only about 4,000 CISSP holders in Japan, providing strong differentiation
  - Directly relevant to CISO and security manager career paths

### Global

- **CISSP**: Recognized worldwide as the premier information security certification. Listed in the U.S. Department of Defense Directive 8570 for IAM/IAT positions
- **RISS**: Limited recognition outside Japan, though it demonstrates Japanese security standards proficiency

### Salary Impact

- CISSP holders earn an average of approximately $130,000 USD globally
- RISS holders may receive monthly certification allowances ranging from ¥10,000 to ¥50,000 depending on their employer

## Recommended Certification Roadmap

### Path 1: Early-Career Engineers

1. **Fundamental Information Technology Engineer Examination** — Build a solid IT foundation
2. **Applied Information Technology Engineer Examination** — Earn Morning I exemption for RISS
3. **RISS** — Establish security specialization
4. **CISSP** — Pursue after accumulating 5 years of experience for global recognition

### Path 2: Experienced Professionals (5+ Years)

- **Study for RISS and CISSP in parallel** for maximum efficiency
- Earning RISS first covers a significant portion of CISSP's technical domains
- Conversely, CISSP's management perspective strengthens RISS afternoon exam preparation

### Path 3: Global / Foreign-Company Focus

1. Prioritize **CISSP** as the primary certification
2. Add **RISS** if working within the Japanese market
3. Consider **CCSP** (Cloud Security) or **OSCP** (Penetration Testing) for further specialization

### Study Tips

- **CISSP**: Work through the official study guide (CBK) and practice exams repeatedly. Train yourself to "think like a manager" when answering questions
- **RISS**: Past exam practice is the most effective strategy. IPA publishes all past exams and answers for free on their official website
- **Both**: Follow security news and real-world incident reports regularly to build practical understanding

## Conclusion

CISSP and RISS each bring distinct strengths as security certifications:

- **Focused on a career in Japan** → Start with RISS
- **Aiming for a global career** → Prioritize CISSP
- **Want comprehensive coverage** → RISS first, then CISSP

Holding both certifications positions you as a well-rounded security professional recognized both domestically and internationally.
