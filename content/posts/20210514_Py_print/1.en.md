## Overwriting a Single Line

To overwrite a single line, use `\r` (carriage return). This control character moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.

```python
print("\r" + "Overwriting a single line!", end="")
```

Use `end=""` to prevent a newline character from being printed, keeping the cursor on the same line.

## Overwriting Multiple Lines

To overwrite multiple lines, you can use special ANSI escape codes. The sequence `\033[nA` moves the cursor up `n` lines.

```python
import time

print("First line")
print("Second line")
print("Third line")

time.sleep(1) # Wait for a second to see the initial output

# Move cursor up 2 lines (from the current position, which is after "Third line")
# and then overwrite the second and third lines.
print("\033[2A" + "New Second line\n" + "New Third line")
```
