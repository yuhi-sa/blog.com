Vim is a powerful text editor loved by many developers for its efficient operation. Here, I'll introduce the basic operations of Vim and recommended plugins to improve development efficiency.

## Basic Vim Operations

Vim has multiple modes, each allowing different operations.

### Mode Switching

- `i`: **Insert Mode**. Allows text input.
- `Esc` key: **Normal Mode**. Allows command execution and cursor movement.
- `v`: **Visual Mode**. Allows text selection and manipulation.
- `:`: **Command-line Mode**. Allows entering and executing commands.

### Navigation in Normal Mode

- `h`: Move left
- `j`: Move down
- `k`: Move up
- `l`: Move right
- `w`: Move to the beginning of the next word
- `b`: Move to the beginning of the previous word
- `{`: Move to the beginning of the paragraph
- `}`: Move to the end of the paragraph
- `gg`: Move to the beginning of the file
- `G`: Move to the end of the file
- `0`: Move to the beginning of the line
- `$`: Move to the end of the line

### Saving and Exiting Files

- `:w`: Save (overwrite)
- `:q`: Quit (only if no changes)
- `:q!`: Discard changes and force quit
- `:wq`: Save and quit
- `:x`: Save and quit (nearly the same as `:wq`)

### Operations in Normal Mode

- `x`: Delete the character at cursor position
- `dd`: Delete the current line
- `dw`: Delete from cursor to end of word
- `2dd`: Delete 2 lines starting from the current line
- `u`: Undo the last operation
- `Ctrl + r`: Redo the undone operation
- `yy`: Copy (yank) the current line
- `p`: Paste **below** the cursor position
- `P`: Paste **above** the cursor position
- `2yy`: Copy 2 lines starting from the current line
- `.`: Repeat the last operation

### Search and Replace

- `/search_term`: Search downward
- `?search_term`: Search upward
- `n`: Move to the next search result
- `N`: Move to the previous search result
- `:%s/before/after/g`: Replace all occurrences in the file
- `:%s/before/after/gc`: Replace all occurrences in the file (with confirmation)

### Other Useful Operations

- `o`: Insert a new line below the current line and enter Insert Mode
- `O`: Insert a new line above the current line and enter Insert Mode
- `J`: Join the current line with the next line

### `.vimrc` Configuration Example

By adding the following settings to the `~/.vimrc` file, you can customize Vim's behavior and plugins.

```vim
" Set shell to zsh (change to your preferred shell)
set shell=/bin/zsh

" Indentation settings
set shiftwidth=4    " Auto-indent width
set tabstop=4       " Tab character display width
set expandtab       " Convert tabs to spaces
set autoindent      " Enable auto-indentation

" Search settings
set hlsearch        " Highlight search results

" Clipboard settings (sync with system clipboard)
set clipboard=unnamed

" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on

" Vim Plug initialization
call plug#begin()
Plug 'ntk148v/vim-horizon'
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
call plug#end()

" Color scheme settings
set termguicolors   " Enable terminal True Color (for correct color scheme display)
colorscheme horizon " Apply horizon color scheme

" lightline.vim configuration example (a plugin to customize the status line)
" If using lightline.vim, also add Plug 'itchyny/lightline.vim'
" let g:lightline = {}
" let g:lightline.colorscheme = 'horizon'
```
