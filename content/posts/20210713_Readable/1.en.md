*The Art of Readable Code: Simple and Practical Techniques for Writing Better Code* provides concrete guidelines for writing code that is easy to read and understand. Below is a summary of its key points.

## 1. Pack Information into Names

Names, starting with variables, should clearly convey their role and content.

-   **Use specific words instead of generic ones**:
    | Generic Word | Alternatives |
    | :----------- | :--------- |
    | `get`        | `fetch`, `download`, `retrieve` |
    | `size`       | `height`, `numNodes`, `memoryBytes` |
    | `stop`       | `kill`, `pause`, `halt` |
    | `send`       | `deliver`, `dispatch`, `announce`, `distribute`, `route` |
    | `find`       | `search`, `extract`, `locate`, `recover` |
    | `start`      | `launch`, `create`, `begin`, `open` |
    | `make`       | `create`, `setUp`, `build`, `generate`, `compose`, `add`, `new` |

-   **Use concrete names instead of abstract ones**:
    -   `tmp` should only be used for variables with very short lifetimes where temporary storage is the most important aspect.
    -   For iterator variables, instead of using `i`, `j`, `k`, use descriptive names like `club_idx`, `member_idx`, `user_idx`.
    -   Use more direct and explicit expressions:
        ```
        // Bad
        ServerCanStart
        // Good
        CanListenOnPort
        ```

-   **Add information with suffixes and prefixes**:
    -   `delay` -> `delay_secs` (unit)
    -   `size` -> `size_mb` (unit)
    -   `limit` -> `max_kbp` (limit)
    -   `angle` -> `degree_cw` (unit and direction)
    -   `html` -> `html_utf8` (encoding)

-   **Choose appropriate name length**:
    -   Shorten overly long names:
        -   `FormatString` -> `FormatStr`
        -   `ConvertToString` -> `ToString`
    -   Lengthen overly short names.

-   **Convey information through name formatting**:
    -   Embed meaning in naming conventions such as capitalization and underscores (e.g., use all uppercase with underscores for constants).

## 2. Use Names That Can't Be Misunderstood

Choose names carefully so readers won't misinterpret them.

-   **Watch out for ambiguous words**:
    -   `filter` -> `select` (include), `exclude` (exclude)
    -   `clip` -> `remove` (delete), `truncate` (cut short)

-   **Indicate limits**:
    -   Use `max` or `limit` for maximum values, and `min` for minimum values.
    -   Examples: `max_users`, `min_length`

-   **Indicate ranges**:
    -   Use `first` and `last` for inclusive ranges.
    -   Use `begin` and `end` for exclusive ranges.

-   **Boolean variable names**:
    -   Prefix boolean variables with `is_`, `has_`, `can_`, `should_` to make true/false meaning clear.
    -   Examples: `is_valid`, `has_permission`, `can_read`, `should_process`

-   **Match user expectations**:
    -   `get` methods are generally expected to be lightweight accessors with no side effects. For expensive computations or operations with side effects, use verbs like `compute` or `calculate`.
    -   `size` methods are expected to return in $O(1)$ time. If computation is involved, use names like `count` or `calculate_size`.

## 3. Aesthetics (Code Formatting and Layout)

Code appearance significantly impacts readability.

-   **Use layouts consistent with patterns readers are familiar with**: Follow coding conventions of the project or language.
-   **Make similar code look similar**: Format structurally similar code blocks in the same way.
-   **Group related code into blocks**: Separate logically related lines with blank lines.
-   **Use consistent line breaks**: Standardize line break rules to reduce visual noise.
-   **Align vertical lines**: Align assignment operators or arguments vertically to make code structure easier to grasp.
    ```python
    details  = request.POST.get('detail')
    location = request.POST.get('location')
    phone    = request.POST.get('phone')
    ```
-   **Use meaningful ordering**: Arrange variable declarations or function arguments in a logical order.
-   **Group declarations into blocks**: Gather related variable declarations in one place, such as the beginning of a code block.

## 4. Comments

Write comments to supplement "why" and "what" that code alone cannot convey.

-   **Don't comment on things immediately obvious from code**: e.g., `i = 0; // Initialize i to 0` is unnecessary.
-   **Comment on constants**: Use named constants instead of magic numbers, and supplement them with comments explaining their meaning.
-   **Avoid pronouns**: Avoid "it" or "this" and use specific nouns instead.
-   **Describe function behavior precisely**: Concisely and accurately describe the function's purpose, parameters, return values, side effects, and exceptions.
-   **Use inline comments for unclear arguments**: Add comments at the call site when argument meanings are not obvious.
