# How to Sync Google Sub-Calendars with Apple Native Devices

When setting up your Google account on Apple native devices like iPhone, iPad, or Mac, the main Google Calendar usually syncs automatically. However, sub-calendars (calendars displayed under "My calendars" or shared calendars) often do not sync by default. To display these sub-calendars in your Apple Calendar app, you need to adjust the following settings.

## Sync Settings Steps

1.  Access the Google Calendar sync settings page in your web browser:
    [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/syncselect](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/syncselect)

2.  On this page, you will see a list of all calendars associated with your Google account. Check the box next to each sub-calendar you wish to sync.

3.  There is no specific "Save" button. Your settings will be saved automatically once you check the boxes.

4.  Open the "Calendar" app on your Apple device and wait for the synchronization to complete. If you have a stable Wi-Fi connection, the sync should finish within a few minutes, and the selected sub-calendars will appear in your Calendar app.

**Notes**:
-   Once this setting is configured for your Google account, it applies to all Apple devices where that account is set up.
-   If the synchronization doesn't reflect immediately, try turning the "Calendars" sync off and then on again from your Apple device's "Settings" app -> "Calendar" -> "Accounts" -> select your Google account.
-   If issues persist, restarting your device might also help.
