SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for operating relational databases. SQL commands are broadly classified into three categories.

## 1. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Commands for manipulating data within a database.

- `SELECT`: Retrieves records (rows) from a database. Results can also be joined.
- `INSERT`: Inserts new records into a database table.
- `UPDATE`: Updates existing records in a database.
- `DELETE`: Deletes records from a database.

## 2. Data Definition Language (DDL)

Commands for defining, modifying, and deleting database structures and objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.).

- `CREATE`: Creates new database objects (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE VIEW`, `CREATE INDEX`).
- `ALTER`: Modifies the structure of existing database objects (e.g., `ALTER TABLE` to add, remove, or modify columns).
- `DROP`: Deletes existing database objects (e.g., `DROP TABLE`, `DROP VIEW`).
- `RENAME`: Renames database objects.
- `TRUNCATE`: Deletes all records from a table while keeping the table structure. Unlike `DELETE`, it usually cannot be rolled back and is faster.

## 3. Data Control Language (DCL)

Commands for managing access privileges to the database and controlling transactions.

- `COMMIT`: Confirms changes made in the current transaction and permanently saves them to the database.
- `ROLLBACK`: Undoes changes made in the current transaction, reverting to the state at the start of the transaction.
- `SAVEPOINT`: Sets a temporary save point within a transaction. You can `ROLLBACK` to this save point.
- `GRANT`: Grants access privileges to database objects for users or roles.
- `REVOKE`: Revokes access privileges to database objects from users or roles.

By combining these commands, you can perform various operations including database design, data management, and security configuration.
