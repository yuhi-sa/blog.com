**Table joins (JOINs)** in SQL are used to combine related data from multiple tables. Since relational database design splits tables (normalization) to eliminate data redundancy, joins are a critical operation.

## 1. INNER JOIN

An inner join returns only the rows from both tables that satisfy the join condition. It is the most commonly used join type.

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON join_condition;
```
-   `table1`, `table2`: Names of the tables to join.
-   `join_condition`: Specifies the criteria for the join. Typically compares columns common to both tables (such as primary key and foreign key relationships) using `=`.

**Example:**
Join the `orders` table and `customers` table by `customer_id` to retrieve order information and customer names.
```sql
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    c.customer_name
FROM
    orders AS o
INNER JOIN
    customers AS c
ON
    o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

### `NATURAL JOIN`

`NATURAL JOIN` automatically uses columns with **the same name** in both tables as the join key. There is no need to explicitly specify the join condition with an `ON` clause.

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
NATURAL JOIN table2;
```
**Caution**: All columns with matching names are used as join conditions, which may lead to unintended joins. Using explicit `INNER JOIN` with an `ON` clause is recommended.

## 2. OUTER JOIN

An outer join returns rows that satisfy the join condition plus rows from the specified side that do not match. Columns from the non-matching side are filled with `NULL`.

### LEFT OUTER JOIN (LEFT JOIN)

Returns **all rows from the left table** (specified in `FROM`) and matching rows from the right table. If there is no match in the right table, right-side columns contain `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2
ON join_condition;
-- or (OUTER is optional)
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON join_condition;
```
**Example:**
Retrieve all customers and their order information. Customers without orders are also displayed.
```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date
FROM
    customers AS c
LEFT JOIN
    orders AS o
ON
    c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### RIGHT OUTER JOIN (RIGHT JOIN)

Returns **all rows from the right table** (specified after `JOIN`) and matching rows from the left table. If there is no match in the left table, left-side columns contain `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2
ON join_condition;
-- or (OUTER is optional)
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON join_condition;
```
**Example:**
Retrieve all order information and the customer names for those orders.
```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date
FROM
    customers AS c
RIGHT JOIN
    orders AS o
ON
    c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```
**Note**: `RIGHT JOIN` can achieve the same result as `LEFT JOIN` by swapping the table order, so `LEFT JOIN` is generally used more frequently.

## 3. CROSS JOIN

A cross join returns all combinations (Cartesian product) of rows from both tables without specifying a join condition. The result set has "table1 rows x table2 rows" number of rows.

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```
**Example:**
Cross join the `colors` and `sizes` tables to generate all color-size combinations.
```sql
SELECT
    c.color_name,
    s.size_name
FROM
    colors AS c
CROSS JOIN
    sizes AS s;
```
Cross joins are useful for generating specific combinations or creating test data.
