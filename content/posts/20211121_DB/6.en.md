SQL's Data Manipulation Language (DML) is used to add, modify, and delete data within a database.

## 1. Inserting Data (INSERT)

The `INSERT` statement adds new rows (records) to a table.

### Inserting Values for All Columns

When inserting values for all columns in a table, you can omit the column names and specify values in the `VALUES` clause. The order of values must match the column order in the table definition.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```
**Example:**
Add a new product to the `products` table.
```sql
INSERT INTO products
VALUES (101, 'Laptop', 1200.00, 'Electronics', 50);
```

### Inserting Values for Specific Columns

When inserting values for specific columns only, specify the column names after `INSERT INTO`. Unspecified columns will be filled with their default values or `NULL`.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```
**Example:**
Add a product specifying only the product ID, name, and price.
```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price)
VALUES (102, 'Mouse', 25.00);
```

## 2. Updating Data (UPDATE)

The `UPDATE` statement modifies values of existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = new_value1, column2 = new_value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
-   `SET`: Specifies the columns to update and their new values.
-   `WHERE`: Specifies the condition to identify records to update. **Omitting the `WHERE` clause will update ALL records in the table, so extreme caution is required.**

**Example:**
Update the price of the product with `product_id` 101 in the `products` table.
```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = 1150.00
WHERE product_id = 101;
```

You can also update based on existing column values:
```sql
UPDATE products
SET stock = stock * 0.9; -- Reduce all product stock by 10%
```

## 3. Deleting Data (DELETE)

The `DELETE` statement removes records from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
-   `WHERE`: Specifies the condition to identify records to delete. **Omitting the `WHERE` clause will delete ALL records in the table, so extreme caution is required.**

**Example:**
Delete the product with `product_id` 102 from the `products` table.
```sql
DELETE FROM products
WHERE product_id = 102;
```

Delete all records (keeping the table structure):
```sql
DELETE FROM products;
```
**Note**: The `TRUNCATE TABLE` command also deletes all records from a table, but it works differently from `DELETE` internally. `TRUNCATE TABLE` is a DDL command that is usually faster than `DELETE`, but it may not be rollable back since it is not recorded in the transaction log.

Mastering these DML commands enables efficient data management in databases.
