Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures programs around "objects" as fundamental units. This improves code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Components of an Object

Objects model real-world things and concepts, consisting of two elements:

-   **Field**: Represents the data and attributes (state) of an object. Defined as variables.
-   **Method**: Represents the behavior and operations of an object. Defined as functions.

Fields and methods together are called **members**.

## Classes and Instances

-   **Class**: A blueprint or template for objects. Defines what fields and methods an object will have.
-   **Instance**: An actual object created in memory based on a class blueprint.

The operation of creating an instance from a class is called **instantiation**.

## The Three Pillars of OOP

There are three particularly important concepts in object-oriented programming.

### 1. Encapsulation

A mechanism that hides an object's internal structure (fields) from direct external access, allowing manipulation only through exposed methods.

-   **Data hiding**: Fields are declared with access modifiers like `private` to prevent direct external modification.
-   **Exposing methods for field manipulation**: `public` methods are provided for setting (setters) and getting (getters) field values.

This maintains object integrity, prevents unintended data modifications, and improves code maintainability.

### 2. Inheritance

A mechanism that allows a new class (**subclass** or **child class**) to inherit fields and methods from an existing class (**superclass** or **parent class**).

-   Improves code reusability.
-   Builds hierarchical structures between classes for systematic management.

### 3. Polymorphism

Meaning "many forms," it refers to methods with the same name exhibiting different behavior depending on the object's type (class).

-   **Override**: Redefining a parent class method in a child class.
-   **Interface**: A mechanism that enforces multiple classes to implement common methods.

Polymorphism improves code flexibility and enables uniform handling of different objects.

## UML (Unified Modeling Language)

UML is a standardized notation for visually representing the design and structure of software systems. It is used in various phases of system development.

Common UML diagrams:
-   **Class Diagram**: Represents classes, their attributes, operations, and relationships (inheritance, associations, etc.) within a system.
-   **Sequence Diagram**: Represents the temporal sequence of messages (method calls) exchanged between objects.
-   **Use Case Diagram**: Represents the system's functions (use cases) and the users (actors) who interact with them.
-   **Activity Diagram**: Represents the flow of a system or business process, including the sequence of activities and conditional branches.
-   **Component Diagram**: Represents the physical components (modules, libraries, etc.) that make up the system and their dependencies.
