## Motivation
With all the data breach incidents in the news lately, I was worried about making a similar mistake. (Back in college, I accidentally wiped out my student club's database...)
Of course, anyone's PC could be hacked, and I don't think blaming the person is a good culture. But I still really don't want my PC to be the cause of a data breach!
So I decided to start building knowledge, and as a first step, I got the [Registered Information Security Specialist (RISS)](https://www.ipa.go.jp/shiken/kubun/sc.html) certification from IPA.
I passed that partly by luck, so I wanted to study more. That's when I heard about the [CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)](https://japan.isc2.org/cissp_about.html) certification in the security industry, and decided to take it. (The name sounds cool too...)

### Note
To receive CISSP certification, you need to both pass the exam and have 5 years of professional experience.
Since I don't have enough professional experience yet, I currently have Associate member status. So technically, I haven't obtained CISSP -- I've only passed the CISSP exam.

## Study Period and Materials
- Study period: early June to late September 2024
- Choosing materials: Since I didn't know anyone with the certification, I asked a security specialist at my company for advice.

* CISSP Official Practice Tests (Japanese Edition)

## What I Did
1. Got an overview of the material from articles.
2. Went through the Udemy courses twice.
3. Read the CISSP CBK Official Guide once + solved the included questions 3 times.
4. Went through the CISSP Official Practice Tests 4 times.

## Cost
It cost more than I expected. (All self-funded.)
* CISSP CBK Official Guide: 27,500 yen
* CISSP Official Practice Tests: 3,300 yen
* Exam fee: 144,469 yen
* ISC2 registration fee: 7,420 yen
Total: 182,689 yen
Including cafe costs for weekend studying and related books, it exceeds 200,000 yen. (Denny's drink bar at 308 yen was a lifesaver.)

### Note
I chickened out and bought a two-attempt exam voucher using this campaign, so the exam fee is a bit higher:

I wish I could be the kind of person who goes all-in on the first attempt...

## The Exam
The CISSP exam can only be taken at two locations in Japan -- Tokyo and Osaka -- and only on weekdays, which made scheduling difficult. In the end, I took a day off the day before a trip to Korea to take the exam.

At the testing center, there were strict security checks including vein authentication and photo registration. This is all for the certification's credibility. I was also surprised that results were printed out the same day.

## Reflections
### The Good
- Gained broad knowledge
    - My knowledge expanded tremendously, from communication protocols to physical security of data centers.
- Made new discoveries
    - Understanding the underlying mechanisms of things I use in daily work changed my perspective. Learning about WPA, RADIUS, Kerberos authentication, and others was particularly valuable.
- Deeper understanding of company policies

### The Bad
- A lot of money gone at once
    - Before I knew it, I had also ordered an iPhone 16 Plus and Apple Watch 10... Starting next month, I'm definitely switching to a frugal lifestyle.

### Future Goals
- Apply to my work
    - I want to leverage this security knowledge in daily development and operations.
- Aim for full membership
    - Build professional experience to move from "Associate" to full member. I want to take on more security-related projects and earn trust within the company!

## In Closing
Thank you to anyone who stuck with this rambling post (if anyone actually did).
This serves as a memorial for the exam fees and my iPhone 16 Plus and Apple Watch 10.
