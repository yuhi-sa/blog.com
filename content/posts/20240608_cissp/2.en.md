To effectively manage security governance, the following major security models are available.

## Biba Integrity Model

- Creator: Kenneth J. Biba
- Year: 1977
- Country: United States
- Features:
- - A security model designed to protect data integrity.
- - The main rule is "no write up, no read down," preventing low-trust-level data from being written to higher trust levels and preventing higher-trust-level data from being read by lower trust levels.
- - Primarily used for maintaining data integrity in commercial environments.
- Differences:
- - Specializes in integrity; confidentiality and availability are not in scope.
- - Better suited for commercial rather than military use.

## Clark-Wilson Model

- Creators: David D. Clark and David R. Wilson
- Year: 1987
- Country: United States
- Features:
- - A model designed to ensure the security of commercial transactions.
- - Maintains integrity using three key concepts: CDI (Constrained Data Items), TP (Transformation Procedures), and IVP (Integrity Verification Procedures).
- - Emphasizes separation of duties to prevent fraud.
- Differences:
- - Specializes in transactions and integrity; other security attributes are secondary.
- - Particularly suited for commercial environments.

## Brewer-Nash Model (Chinese Wall Model)

- Creators: David F.C. Brewer and Michael J. Nash
- Year: 1989
- Country: United Kingdom
- Features:
- - A model designed to prevent conflicts of interest.
- - Once a user accesses information, their access to competing data is restricted based on what they have previously accessed.
- - Primarily used in finance and law.
- Differences:
- - Specializes in conflict-of-interest management; other security attributes are not in scope.
- - Provides dynamic access control.

## Bell-LaPadula Model

- Creators: David E. Bell and Leonard J. LaPadula
- Year: 1973
- Country: United States
- Features:
- - A security model designed to protect confidentiality.
- - The main rule is "no read up, no write down," preventing users with lower clearance from reading higher-clearance data and preventing users with higher clearance from writing data to lower clearance levels.
- - Primarily used in military and government organizations.
- Differences:
- - Specializes in confidentiality; integrity and availability are not in scope.
- - Suited for military use and classified information management.
